# Final Project for Meghana Chandra and Erik Mueller
For this project, we have selected four datasets and merged them together.
These datasets include:
1. The University of Maryland - College Park's Global Terrorism Database dataset (joining to parts, the almost complete set and the indpenendent values for 1993).
2. Chebuib, Gandhi, and Vreeland's Democracy and Dictatorship dataset.
3. The Gapminder dataset for country area by year.
4. The Gapminder dataset for country population by year.

The merged version of these four datasets selects for the years extending from 1970 - 2008. This selection is made due to it being the years for which each dataset has values. An issue emerged for North and South Vietnam, in that the Gapminder datasets do not seem to include them individually.
